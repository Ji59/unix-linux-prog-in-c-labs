1) Thread pool

   usage: `./a.out number_of_threads`

   - dynamically allocate number of threads and keep the count of threads the same even if some of them exit
     - the threads can sleep for a random amount of time and then return
     - use specified (on command line) number of threads
     - variant: use sysconf(3) to get number of online processors and create the same number of threads

   - use condvar to signal that thread is about to return so that main thread can resupply if needed
     - use pthread_cleanup_push() with pthread_exit() or just signal the condvar before return
       - beware: the pthread_cleanup_pop/push can be implemented as macros, see
	 the man page for details on how to use them properly

   - detach the threads so no joining is needed
     - better using the thread attr for pthread_create() to avoid race condition
       which happens when using pthread_detach() in thread function
       (if the thread returned before call to pthread_detach())

   - variant: use atomic integer and a signal to poke the main thread
     - the signal should be real-time or use sigqueue/siginfo not to lose events

   - verify with ps(1) (use -L on Linux) that the number of threads in the pool remains more or less the same
